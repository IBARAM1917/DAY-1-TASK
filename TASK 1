 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1.1
     In 1997,when http/1.1 published
     It uses requests resource inlining for use gelting multiple pages
     Is an application layer protocol in the internet protocol suite model for distibute
     Multiplexing of requests and responses to avoid some of the head of line blacking problems
     It compresses data by itself
     Working on textual format
     Transferss these in plain-text messages
     Flow control relies on underlying TCP connection
     Compress the data sent in HTTP message,especially to decrease the size of css and javascript files
     This allows them to maximize perceived and actual page load speed to a degree that was not possible
HTTP/2
     HTTP/2 was created in 2015
     It uses PUSH frame by sever that collects all multiple pages
     Major verision of the http network portocol used by the world wide web
     Additional performance improvements in the first draft of http/2
     It uses HAPACK for data compression
     BINARRY PTOTOCOL
     Encodes these into binary ,allowing for significantly different delivery model possiblities
     Mulitiplexes streams of data within a single TCP connection 
     The same is true when it come to header compression
     This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first every time
